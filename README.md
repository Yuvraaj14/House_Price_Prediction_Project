House Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project repository! In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features and data. This README provides an overview of the project and its contents.

Project Overview

Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to create a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices.

Dataset:
We have used a comprehensive dataset containing various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

Methods:
We employ various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and feature engineering to build and optimize our prediction model.

Repository Contents

Data:
You will find the dataset in the directory. It includes both training and testing data.

Notebooks:
Jupyter notebooks in the directory contain the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

Models:
We provide pre-trained machine learning models in the directory for immediate use.

Documentation:
Detailed project documentation, including the data dictionary and model evaluation metrics, can be found in the directory.

Usage:
If you want to run the code yourself, follow the instructions in the directory.
